    <h3>Project #1: Car Builder</h3>
    <h4>We made a program where you can build a car on command with an F1 garage as the background.</h4>

    <h3>Project #2: Snake</h3>
    <h4>For this project, we recreated Snake and made it so you can choose what color snake you like at the beginning. The snake is controlled by arrow keys and the objective is to eat apples to obtain a higher score. Every apple eaten makes the snake longer and therefore, easier to crash. However, you must be careful of the obstacles and borders of the game, as it will reset your score.</h4>

    <h3>Project #3: Veteran's Day E-Card</h3>
    <h4>We created a Happy Veteran's Day card that features fireworks, a bald eagle, the american flag as the background, a picture of a soldier saluting, and background music.</h4>
