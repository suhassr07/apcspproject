    <h3>Project #1: Car Builder</h3>
    <h4>We made a program where you can build a car on command with an F1 garage as the background.</h4>

    <h3>Project #2: Snake</h3>
    <h4>For this project, we recreated Snake and made it so you can choose what color snake you like at the beginning. The snake is controlled by arrow keys and the objective is to eat apples to obtain a higher score. Every apple eaten makes the snake longer and therefore, easier to crash. However, you must be careful of the obstacles and borders of the game, as it will reset your score.</h4>

    <h3>Project #3: Veteran's Day E-Card</h3>
    <h4>We created a Happy Veteran's Day card that features fireworks, a bald eagle, the American flag as the background, a picture of a soldier saluting, and background music.</h4>

    <h3>Project #4: Fish Tank Monitor</h3>
    <h4>In this project, we learned about cybersecurity by securing a fish tank monitoring system from potential cyber attacks. Additionally, we had to debug the code for the monitoring system as it was not functioning as intended.</h4>

    <h3>Project #5: Whack-a-Cat</h3>
    <h4>For this project, we recreated the popular carnival game Whack-a-Mole. This recreation features a scoreboard and timer to challenge you to get the best score possible within 30 seconds!</h4>

    <h3>Project #6: Rover Data Project</h3>
    <h4>We had to interpret data collected by the rover and compare it to the characteristics of five regions on an alien planet to deduce where the rover is located. We concluded that the rover is situated in the marshlands since the temperature graph indicates a constant temperature. Additionally, the sound graph shows constant chirping and buzzing sounds.</h4>
